						<h2>What is a paragraph?</h2>
						<p>A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity:</p>
						<h2>How do I unify my ideas in a paragraph?</h2>
						<p>Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.
						  Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point.
						  Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph.
						  Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity.
						  <p>An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence
						  Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences.</p>
						  <p>In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.</p>
						  <p>This topic sentence forecasts the central idea or main point of the paragraph: “politicians” and “journalists” rely on Twitter. The rest of the paragraph will focus on these two Twitter-user groups, thereby fulfilling the promise made by the topic sentence. 
						  By avoiding irrelevant information that does not relate to the topic sentence, you can compose a unified paragraph.</p>
